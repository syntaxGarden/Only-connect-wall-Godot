# Only-connect-wall-Godot
The "connecting wall" from BBC's quiz show Only Connect, recreated in Godot 3.5.2. This game is not official in any way, and Syntax Garden is not associated with the BBC at all. This is a fan project and nothing more.

 ~First commit: The initial game files, but without the copyrighted game files, the removal of which caused the wall to not load. In addition, the answers scene didn't work right.

 ~Second commit (current): The game now has copyright free music which plays during the wall scene (Someone Else by Waking Dreams) and a fixed answers scene.
